# hello-world-blockchain
My first project interacting with smart contracts.
Here are my note about the course [Blockchain e Solidity: Criando Smart Contracts e Tokens](https://cursos.alura.com.br/course/solidity-criando-smart-contracts-tokens) .

### How to understand what problem Blockchain can solve:
<p>The instructor explained the digitalization of our lives. Everything now happens in
the digital space and there is a concern about how easy things can be copied.
This is the key point of tokenization. With blockchain technology, it is possible to verify and control
the real ownership of that a document, artwork, money etc. 
<pl>Basically, tokens are, digital assets that are created and managed using smart contracts on existing blockchains
like Ethereum, Solana, Polygon. 

The blockchain ecosystm is a bit different from the tradicional digital world, so naturally , its programming language and tools are also different.
Blockchain is often referred to as web3. This name comes from the factthat everything is decentralized, whith node running arround the world.

### Tools development:
[Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/)
   
[Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/) -> using Solidity

### Libs (ecosystem JS):
<p>Web3.js
<p>Ethers.js

In the course it was used Foundry with the programming language Sodility and Ethers.js.
